Mr. Sidney Crashaw, of Stoke House, Fulham, and King's Pomeroy, Devon, was found, after a prolonged search, hanging dead from the branch of a tree in his garden at one o'clock today.  The deceased gentleman dined last night at the Carlton Club and seemed in his usual health and spirits. He left the club at about ten o'clock, and was seen walking leisurely up St. James's Street a little later.  Subsequent to this his movements cannot be traced.  On the discovery of the body medical aid was at once summoned, but life had evidently been long extinct.  So far as is known, Mr. Crashaw had no trouble or anxiety of any kind.  This painful suicide, it will be remembered, is the fifth of the kind in the last month.  The authorities at Scotland Yard are unable to suggest any explanation of these terrible occurrences.\"\"\"\n",
